This directory contains a GraphPad prism file in which we performed a binomial test for whether our observation that 1/144 crossovers were associated with loss of heterozygosity when 2/3 of them should have been would be expected by chance.
In the same file, we used the Wilson/Brown method to construct a 95% Confidence Interval for the proportion of offspring that bear segemental loss of heterozygosity on one or more chromosomes. This method is recommded when proportions are low
or are close to zero, which was indeed the case for our data (none of 15 offspring bore a segmental loss of heterozygosity).
