Here I document the commands I used to process, align, and call variants among all standard short read whole genome sequencing data.
Alignment comes before variant calling.
I also include here the code I used to identify read depth at all sites, and to obtain read depth summaries.
All of these computational steps were performed at different times for different DNA sequencing runs,
so instead of providing each of those instances separately, I here outline the general strategy used with "dummy" sample names.
