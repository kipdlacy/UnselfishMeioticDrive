Here I document the statistics performed on the developmental mortality rates which are illustrated in Figure 1 of the main text.
Developemental mortality rates were recorded for seven replicate colonies with 46 transgenic eggs, 40 wild-type adults, and 38 wild-type pupae to provide nutrition (as described in the Methods).
The number of eggs surviving to pupation was recorded.
